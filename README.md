# DisneyFriendFinder

### Overview

This full-stack site will take in results from the user's survey, then compare their answers with those from disney characters. The app will then display the name and picture of the disney Character with the best overall match. 
To Determine the user's most compatible disney friend using the following:

   * Convert each user's results into a simple array of numbers (ex: `[5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]`).
   * With that done, the difference will be compared between current user's scores against others, question by question and then be sumed up. 
   * The closest match will be the disney character with the least amount of difference.
